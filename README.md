# 🧠Healthcare Multi-Agent System

This project showcases the **design and modeling of a Healthcare Multi-Agent System (MAS). The system simulates intelligent coordination between autonomous agents such as patients, doctors, schedulers, and triage evaluators, with the help of a Machine Learning / LLM backend.

## 📌 Overview

Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) involves autonomous entities—**agents**—that interact, collaborate, and make decisions to achieve system-wide goals. **AUML (Agent UML)** is a modeling language that extends UML to express such complex interactions, behaviors, and roles in multi-agent systems.

In this project, we use AUML to model:
- Patient symptom submission
- Automated triage via ML/LLM
- ICU assignment for critical cases
- Appointment scheduling for non-urgent cases

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository includes:

- ✅ **AUML Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram (Agent Interaction)
  - Agent Class Diagram
  - Agent Goal Diagram

- ✅ **Code snippets (PlantUML)**
  - Easily editable for rendering with tools like PlantUML or integrated IDE plugins.
